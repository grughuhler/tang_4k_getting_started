This directory contains an example showing how to get started with the
Cortex M3 ARM core on the Tang Nano 4K FPGA development board.

There is a Gowin program file for the Gowin FPGA.  The Verilog is very
simple.  It does nothing but instantiate the M3 and connect a UART
and some GPIOs to pins.

There is also a minimalist sotfware application in directory c_code.
See the README there.
